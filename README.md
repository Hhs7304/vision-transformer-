# 🔍 Vision Transformer (ViT) Project

Welcome to the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** project! This project demonstrates the power of **Transformer architectures** in computer vision tasks like image classification. Using a simple yet effective implementation, we explore how **Vision Transformers** outperform traditional convolutional models in specific tasks by leveraging self-attention mechanisms.

## 🚀 Features

- **Transformer-based Architecture**: Utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification tasks.
- **Pretrained Models**: Uses pretrained weights to fine-tune and achieve faster results with fewer computational resources.
- **Custom Datasets**: Easily extendable to train on custom datasets.
- **State-of-the-art Performance**: Achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters compared to CNNs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for coding the Vision Transformer.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for building and training the Vision Transformer.
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: Library for leveraging pretrained transformer models.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training metrics and results.



## 📊 Example Results

Once the training is completed, you’ll see accuracy and loss plots in the `results/` folder.

## 🔍 Vision Transformer Architecture

The **Vision Transformer** breaks down images into patches, applies **self-attention** across these patches, and processes them similarly to sequences in NLP tasks.

Key steps in ViT:
1. **Patch Embeddings**: The image is divided into fixed-size patches, which are linearly embedded.
2. **Position Embeddings**: Added to retain positional information.
3. **Transformer Encoder**: Processes the embeddings through layers of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks.
4. **Classification Head**: Outputs class predictions.

## 🧪 Experiment with Custom Datasets

You can use any image classification dataset by placing your dataset in the `data/custom_dataset/` folder and organizing it into subfolders by class. The script will automatically detect and train on the new dataset.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add support for **image segmentation** tasks using Vision Transformers.
- Experiment with **data augmentation** techniques for improving performance.
- Implement **transfer learning** on various pretrained transformer models.
- Extend for **multi-modal tasks** by combining text and vision transformers.
